Huawei Balong is a series of custom System-on-Chip used in all Huawei LTE routers and USB sticks, except for some selected models with Qualcomm Snapdragon targeted for USA market. This is a custom silicon with 2 ARMv7 cores for Linux and VxWorks, 1 Cortex-M3 core for boot-up and M3 Monitor, and ConnX BBE16 DSP for baseband. Several models include additional HiFi audio DSP core for audio communications.

The newest Balong 5000 has ARMv8 architecture and additional cores for 5G communication.

Current 4G generation of portable routers is **Balong Hi6932 V7R22** (all models are LTE cat. 6).
These models have **256 MB RAM** (128 MB available for Linux, 80 MB free) and **256 MB NAND**. Routers use **Hi1151 Huawei** or **Broadcom BCM4356** Wi-Fi chipset.
V7R22 devices run Linux 3.10.59 kernel with Android modifications. ARMv7 cores has vfpv4 and NEON floating point operation support.

_*_ There are different modifications of this router: E5573s, E5573Cs, E5573Bs, which differs in hardware.

**Balong Hi6930 V7R2**, the older generation, brings devices with **128 MB NAND** and **128/256 MB RAM**, which run Linux 3.4.5 with Android modifications, contain **Broadcom 43241 or 4354** Wi-Fi chips. ARMv7 cores come without floating point support. These devices are **not getting firmware updates anymore**, and most probably are vulnerable to [KRACK](https://www.krackattacks.com/) and [BroadPWN](https://blog.exodusintel.com/2017/07/26/broadpwn/) vulnerabilities.
